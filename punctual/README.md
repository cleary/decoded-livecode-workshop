### About

[Punctual](https://github.com/dktr0/Punctual) is a language for live coding audio and visuals. It allows you to build and change networks of signal processors (oscillators, filters, etc) on the fly.

Punctual runs in a web browser, and is portable to any system with a browser that supports the Web Audio API (for sound) and WebGL (for video). While it can be used in a standalone way, it is also bundled inside the Estuary platform for collaborative live coding.

The Worksheets provided cover the visual capabilities of Punctual only, specifically inside [Estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca). The content should work equally well for [standalone Punctual](https://dktr0.github.io/Punctual/) with minimal adjustments
