# MiniTidal Audio Workshop 1-1 - First Creations (~0.5h)

## Setup Cells!

```
!presetview twocolumns
```

Choose MiniTidal from the language dropdown for both cells

## Making your first sounds

In the leftmost cell, create a kick (bass) drum sound that plays once each **cycle**

```
sound "bd"
```

To **evaluate**, or **execute** the code (programming jargon) - press the **Play** button associated with the cell

You can also evaluate a cell using `Shift + Enter`

Let's evaluate a sound in the rightmost cell

```
sound "~ sd"
```

Each cell can be thought of as a stereo audio channel - the second example introduces a basic sequence within a cycle, with two elements:
 - a rest `~`, and a 
 - snare drum sound `sd`

Tidal takes the pattern provided between the quotes, and fits it evenly into one **cycle**

## Silence!

`silence` is important! In music, and especially in Tidal - you can stop your audio streams in a number of ways

Appending `# silence` to the end of the code block in a cell, and evaluating

```
sound "bd"
# silence
```

Or by removing all the code in the cell, and evaluating the blank cell - a good keyboard shortcut for this is:

 - Select All `Ctrl+A`, then 
 - `Backspace` or `Delete`, then
 - Evaluate `Shift+Enter`

I tend to use this method because it's quicker, and you can very easily bring your code back with the keyboard shortcut
  - Undo `Ctrl+Z`

## Exploring Sounds available in Estuary

Open a new browser tab, and go to 

  https://estuary.mcmaster.ca

Click on the `Solo Mode` item, and type the following into the chat/terminal window (brace yourself):

```
!localview audiomap
```

This displays a list of all the available sample names for use in Tidal.

Note that each sample name is actually a folder, containing a number of (usually) related sample files. 

You can choose a different sample from within the folder by appending a number (counting from `0`)

```
sound "sd:0 sd:1"
```

By default, if you don't specify which numbered sample to play, tidal will use `samplename:0`

**Explore!** find two new samples that you like (you may like the sound, or the name of the sample - either is fine!)

## Preview of Patterning Concepts in Tidal

The Tidalcycles language allows short and concise statements to create patterns of sound (or anything!). You can use a variety of different punctuation within the **pattern** to modify the way it behaves.

The exercises for this worksheet are examples that you can explore along with trying different sound samples.

Describe in your own words the effect each operator has on the pattern of sound

# Exercises:

1. Samples can be multiplied by a number (integer) using `*`, explore -

```
sound "bd*2 sd*3"
```

2. Samples can be repeated a number of times using `!`, explore -
```
sound "bd!2 sd!3"
```

3. Describe how `*` differs from `!`?

4. Samples can be divided by a number (integer) using `/`, explore -
```
sound "bd/2 sd/3"
```

## For Bonus Points

5. Explore the use of the `@` operator
```
sound "bd@1 sd@1"
```
