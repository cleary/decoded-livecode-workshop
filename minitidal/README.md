DECODED - an artistic livecoding workshop on the [estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca) platform. 

## Livecoded Visuals with Minitidal (Tidal Cycles)

### Worksheets

 - [1-1. First Creations](/minitidal/1-1.md) (~0.5h)
 - [1-2. Mini-notation Sequencing and Patterning Concepts](/minitidal/1-2.md) (~1h)
 - [1-3. Pitches, Filters and Re-use](/minitidal/1-3.md) (~1h)
 - [1-4. Pattern Mod Func and Randomness](/minitidal/1-4.md) (~1h)

### About

[Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) allows you to make patterns with code. It includes language for describing flexible (e.g. polyphonic, polyrhythmic, generative) sequences of sounds, notes, and parameters.

[Minitidal](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary) supports a wide subset of functions and features provided by Tidal Cycles, specifically designed for use with the [estuary web client](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca).

While not feature complete with Tidal Cycles, Minitidal's strengths are twofold:

  - web-based (no installation required to get up and running, Tidal Cycles installation is non-trivial)
  - collaborative by design - it's trivially easy to jam with others, without the inherent security risks posed by common collaborative editors used in Tidal (eg [Flok](https://github.com/munshkr/flok), [Troop](https://github.com/Qirky/Troop))

The Worksheets provided here are designed specifically for use with Estuary, but should work equally well for Tidal Cycles (proper) with minimal adjustments.
