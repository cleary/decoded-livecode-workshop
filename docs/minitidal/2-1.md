# MiniTidal Audio Workshop 2-1 - Binary Patterns (~1.0h)

**Goals:**
 - separate rhythmic patterns for re-use
 - use the `binary` function to create rhythmic patterns
 - explore using binary patterns in other functions

**Reference:**

## Separate/control the rhythmic pattern with `struct`

In the leftmost cell, create a kick (bass) drum sound that plays four times each **cycle**

```
sound "bd bd bd bd"
```

The rhythm can be separated from the `sound` function, by creating `true` events indicating when the event should fit in the cycle
```
struct "t t t t" $ sound "bd"
```

This is a lot of extra typing, so why do it? Because we can make significantly more complicated patterns, and re-use them in other places

`struct` defines a binary pattern of either `t/f` or `1/0` characters, indicating true/false - of course it can be patterned using mini-notation as well

```
struct "<t f> [t f] t [t f]" $ sound "bd"
```

In the right cell, we could re-use this pattern in a number of ways. Let's double it with different sounds
```
struct "<t f> [t f] t [t f]" $ sound "[jazz:5 | glitch:5]"
```

Vary it a little
```
sometimes (ply 2) $ 
struct "<t f> [t f] t [t f]" $ sound "[jazz:5 | glitch:5]"
```

Starting to sound pretty interesting! But we haven't made use of the `false` component of the pattern at all?

Patterns can be **inverted**, turning all the `true` events `false`, and vice versa. In the left pane, create a `stack` and add a **snare** sample on the `false` hits using `inv` to invert the pattern
```
stack [
struct "<t f> [t f] t [t f]" $ sound "bd",
struct (inv "<t f> [t f] t [t f]") $ sound "808sd"
]
```

Euclidean patterns can also be applied - try varying your `808sd` pattern:
```
struct (inv "<t f(3,8)> [t f] t [t f]") $ sound "808sd"
```

## Binary Patterns from Integers

We can generate binary patterns from decimals. The binary number system works similarly to our familiar decimal system, except that you can only use the numbers 0 and 1 to count - all decimal integers can be easily represented as a binary pattern of 1s and 0s.

The `binary` representation of `170` is `10101010` ([Check it!](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html)), where the `1` is an event that will play, and the `0` is a non-playing event.

Clear your previous patterns, and in the left hand cell create a `binary` pattern
```
struct (binary 170) $ sound "bd"
```

By default, `binary` creates an 8-bit pattern ie it is 8 characters in length - this gives you a maximum decimal of `255`. Can you guess what the binary pattern for `255` looks like? (try it!)

Of course, not all music neatly divides into 8 parts! Fortunately, you can specify any number of bits - let's try `12`
```
struct (binaryN 12 2350) $ sound "bd"
```

You can pattern the number of bits as well
```
struct (binaryN "<12 16>" 2350) $ sound "bd"
```

## Using Binary Patterns in Places Other Than `struct`

`mask` takes a binary pattern allowing events to play `1` or not `0`. It can be patterned on a per cycle basis, but is often used to pattern at a whole cycle level

```
mask "<1 0 1>" $ struct (binaryN 12 2350) $ sound "bd"
```

`stitch` is a way to apply two values to an effect as a binary pattern. This pattern alternates `gain` values of `0.6` and `1`
```
sound "bd*8"
# gain (stitch (binary 170) "0.6" "1")
```

I'm a fan of using this on long samples in conjunction with `chop`
```
chop 8 $ sound "moog"
# gain (stitch (binary 170) "0.6" "1")
# cut 1
```

...which then allows opportunities for re-using the binary pattern (or it's invert) with kicks/hihats/snares etc

`while` can take a binary pattern to apply functions or effects accordingly
```
while "{0100101101011}%20" (# cutoff 300) -- pseudo random application of the cutoff effect
$ chop 8 $ sound "moog"
# gain (stitch (binary 170) "0.6" "1")
# cut 1
```
---

# Exercises:

1. Begin by taking a long running sample and `chop` it - then use `mask` and a `binary` pattern to insert gaps in the sample playback

```
slow 4 $ chop 32 $ s "moog"
```

2. Take a second long running sample (eg `ade`) and using the same technique, insert the second sample sound into the gaps from above

## For Bonus Points

3. Use mini-notation to adjust the binary pattern from 1. over different cycles, without changing the pattern playing in 2.

4. Bring the pattern back into the (out of phase) sync with the pattern playing in 2.
