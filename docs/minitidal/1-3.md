## `note` notation for adjusting pitch on your samples

So far we have focussed on rhythmic pattern control for the entirety of this course, however we can also manipulate the pitch of our samples via a number of methods - including the use of `note` notation

`note` can be used in the same way as `n` notation, but rather than affecting which sample is used from the sample folder, `note` affects the pitch of the sample

Let's introduce a new set of samples, `ukulele` by Thomas Grund - these are a set of ukulele notes tuned to concert C (ie *all the same note*) but played with different techniques, note length, vibrato etc. To prove this, let's start with our previous `n` pattern and see how it sounds

```
n "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # sound "ukulele"
```

Some different octaves, but all tuned to C - Let's change to `note`

```
note "0 3 [4 5] [8 7]" # sound "ukulele"
```

*Note: the sample should be tuned to C to give predictable results with `note`*

The numbers used correspond to the 12 tones of the [Chromatic Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale) used in Western Music 

However, `note` can also be directed to work with various [scales](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tour/harmony_melody/#scalelist) based on the 12 tone system

```
note (scale "major" "<[0 1 2 3] [4 5 6 7]>") # sound "ukulele"
```

In this case, each number corresponds to a degree of the **major** scale (counting from 0)

Using our knowledge of square brackets, we can create **chords**

```
note (scale "major" "[[0 1 2 4], [2 3 4 6], [4 5 6 8]]") # sound "ukulele"
```

This is pretty long and unwieldy though!

Luckily you can use [chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) with `note` for much more readable (and writable) code

```
note "[c'maj d'min e'min g'maj]" # sound "ukulele"
```

You can pattern chords

```
note "<[c'maj ~ d'min] e'min [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```

Chords have some available **modifiers** too

Inversions `'i 'ii 'iii` and so on where the lowest note is moved to the top (an octave higher):

```
note "<c'maj'i c'maj'ii c'maj'iii c'maj>" # sound "ukulele"
```

You can change the number of notes in the chord (repeating notes at successively higher octaves)

```
note "<c'maj'6 c'maj>" # sound "ukulele"
```

As the notes get higher the samples get shortened, so it's often prudent to use these modifiers in combination with a change of octave. 

By default, `c` refers to `c5` - we can change that to any relative octave eg `c4` is an octave lower

```
note "<c4'maj'6 c'maj>" # sound "ukulele" -- much better!
```

Try adding some of these modifiers to our original chord progression

```
note "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```

`arp` is a function for use with `note` to **arpeggiate** a chord - ie play the notes of a chord one after the other with a short gap between

```
note (arp "down" "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>") # sound "ukulele"
```

There are a [variety of ways to arpeggiate chords](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/harmony_melody/#arp), try some more!

`arp` divides the cycle by the number of notes in the chord which is why you hear some chords play a faster or slower series of notes.

`@` can affect the length over which the event will apply

```
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

## Re-useable Rhythms with `struct`

Up to this point, we've been keeping many of the components of our musical patterns lumped together. For example, the previous example combines **harmonic/melodic** and **rhythmic** patterns in the one `note` statement. Our melody from `1-2` does the same - 

Sometimes, and especially in a collaborative context, it's desirable to define these elements separately - this can aid reusability for other artists in the room.

`struct` is a function that can be used to define rhythmic patterns using **boolean** or **binary** notation (`t`/`f` , or `1`,`0`) 

Let's begin with our previous chord progression

```
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

In this example, the rhythm is defined by the `arp` function, which creates the same number of events as we have notes in each chord.

Let's keep the individual arpeggiated notes, but define a completely new rhythm - note that `struct` is prepended to the statement (in general, our rhythm patterns are defined on the left)
```
struct "t@2 t*2 t@0.5" $
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

In another cell, let's reuse this rhythm for some percussive content
```
struct "t@2 t*2 t@0.5" $ sound "bd"
```

Or write a bassline? Try this in a different cell to the melody - Notice I've changed the direction of the `arp` function to `up` 
```
struct "t@2 t*2 t@0.5" $
note (arp "up" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "flbass:6"
```

Rhythms in `struct` can also be defined using **binary** patterns - ie `1`s and `0`s instead of `t` and `f` respectively 
```
struct "1@2 1*2 1@0.5" $
note (arp "up" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "flbass:6"
```

Binary patterns get more interesting because they can be generated with the `binary` function. Start with a fresh example
```
struct (binary 170) $ sound "bd"
```

`binary 170` generates the **8 bit** binary pattern `10101010` (ie it is 8 characters in length)

It can be patterned using mininotation
```
struct (binary "<170 129>") $ sound "bd"
```

and is easy to re-use - in another cell, create an `inv` (inverted) pattern for a highhat sample
```
struct (inv (binary "170")) $ sound "hc"
```

It is possible to create binary sequences of any length, using `binaryN` - here's a 16 bit example
```
struct (binaryN 16 "35208") $ sound "bd"
```

You can use a [binary to digital converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-decimal.html) to convert your binary patterns to decimal, and vice versa

## Euclidean Patterns ... great for music?

Euclidean patterns are binary patterns as well - the function takes a number of `true` or `1` events, and a sequence length (eg `8` for an 8-bit binary pattern) then uses a specific formula to fit the number of events to the sequence as evenly as possible.

For example, our `binary 170` pattern can be written as
```
struct "t(4,8)" $ sound "bd"
```

That is, `4` sample events (in this case, `bd`) fitted into a sequence length of `8` which has a pattern that looks like
```
|x.x.x.x.|x.x.x.x.|
```
You can also (optionally) define an offset for the start event, which usually begins on the first downbeat in the bar. This example uses an offset of 1 sequence step
```
struct "t(4,8,1)" $ sound "bd"
```
```
-- old pattern without offset
|x.x.x.x.|x.x.x.x.|
-- new pattern with offset of 1
|.x.x.x.x|.x.x.x.x|
```

Euclidean patterns get rhythmically interesting when you use numbers that don't fit evenly into the sequence. This example fits `5` `bd` events into an `8` slot sequence
```
struct "t(5,8)" $ sound "bd"
```
Which has a pattern that looks like
```
|x.xx.xx.|x.xx.xx.
```
Of course we can pattern them with mininotation
```
struct "t(<3 5>,<8 8 16>,<0 1 3>)" $ sound "bd"
```
...and you can apply `inv` just like in the `binary` examples - in another cell:
```
struct (inv "t(<3 5>,<8 8 16>,<0 1 3>)") $ sound "hc"
```

## Effective Effects!

Effects are filters that you can apply to your sound to change specific properties. They are applied after your code, using a `#` prefix

`gain` affects the loudness of the sound, from 0 (silent) to 1 (default sample volume) - you can go higher, use with caution!

```
sound "ukulele*2"
# gain "1 0.5"
```

`pan` controls which side of the stereo channel the sound goes to - `0` is hard left, `0.5` is the middle, `1` is hard right

```
sound "bd sd cb"
# pan "0 0.5 1"
```

`vowel` shapes the sound according to the vowel you choose...

```
sound "sd*20"
# vowel "a e i o u"
```

`hcutoff` and `cutoff` are high and low pass filters respectively, accepting parameters from `0` to `20000` (Hz)

```
sound "gtr*2"
# hcutoff "<6000 4000 2000 1000 500 300>" -- only play frequencies above num
```
```
sound "gtr*2"
# cutoff "<200 300 500 700 1000 5000>" -- only play frequencies below num
```

`delay`, `delaytime`, and `delayfeedback` are all related parameters to a general `delay` effect

 - `delay`: wet/dry gain up to 1.0
 - `delaytime`: space between delay events, in units of cycles
 - `delayfeedback`: how much gain applies to each subsequent delay event (usually less than 1)

```
sound "jazz:5*2"
# delay 1
# delaytime "<0.125 0.25>"
# delayfeedback 0.7
```

 *Note: be careful with feedback numbers greater than 1!*

## Control your samples length... please!

By now, you will have noticed that not all samples are equal - some have a long playback (many seconds), some are short, and everything in between.

There are several tools we can make use of to control how long the samples play for - the simplest is

`cut` stops one sample playing when the next sample starts playing. Try the following example with and without the `cut`
```
note "0 4 7 10" #  s "flbass:0"
-- # cut 1
```

`begin` and `end` control where in the sample playback should begin from, and end at. `begin` should always take a lower value than `end` (otherwise... ?)
```
note "0 4 7 10" #  s "flbass:0"
# begin 0.02
# end 0.04
```

  *Note: certain samples may introduce little pops with this method (`flbass:0` certainly does!)

## More speed (or less)!

There are a number of ways that speed can affect our sounds - let's break down some common speed adjustments

`!setcps` in the terminal chat - this controls the global estuary tempo, in cycles per second. By default this is set to `0.5 cps` (which is equivalent to `120bpm` for a 4/4 time signature), and due to it being an estuary setting, not a minitidal setting, is not patternable

Try playing a pattern and increasing the cps to `0.75` or `1.0` 
```
!setcps 0.75
```

`speed` is an effect that changes the playback speed of samples (and therefore the pitch) - standard playback speed is `1.0`, try mixing it up

```
sound "sd*4"
# speed "1.0 1.5 0.5 -1"
```
...what is `# speed "-1"` doing?

`fast` and `slow` are **functions** that can change the speed at which the sequence events fire. To apply a function, add it as a prefix to your code, separated by a `$`. They require a **floating point** number as an argument
```
fast 2 $ sound "bd sd"
```
```
slow 1.5 $ sound "bd sd"
```

`hurry` is a **function** that does a combination of both `fast` and `speed`, ie by adjusting sequence playback speed, as well as sample playback speed
```
hurry 2 $ sound "bd sd"
```

# Exercises:

1. There are many more [chord qualities](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/howtos/playchords/) available to use - explore!

2. Try writing a short 2 or 4 cycle melody using `note` and a sample(s) of your choice

3. `fast` and `slow` can actually be used interchangeably - find a way to slow down your melody sequence using `fast`, and vice versa with `slow`

4. Recreate our `hurry` pattern using the `fast` and `speed` functions instead

5. Using our `@` pattern, accompany it with a `bd sd` rhythm, and watch how that changes over two cycles - what is `@` doing to the cycle length?

```
-- cell 1
note (arp "down" "<c4'maj'8@2 [d4'min'ii@0.5 ~@3.5] e4'min'6@1 g'maj@0.5>") # sound "ukulele"
```

```
-- cell 2
sound "bd sd"
```

6. Investigate using multiple samples at a time with a **euclidean** struct pattern, what happens?
```
struct "t(3,8)" $ sound "bd sd"
```

## For Bonus Points

7. Write a chord progression to accompany your melody from 2.

8. Write a 4 cycle melody to accompany our chord progression from the `note` section
```
note "<[c4'maj'8 ~ d4'min'ii] e4'min'6 [~ g'maj]>" # sound "ukulele"
```
