## Livecoded Audio with Minitidal (Tidalcycles)

### About

[Tidalcycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) allows you to make patterns with code. It includes language for describing flexible (e.g. polyphonic, polyrhythmic, generative) sequences of sounds, notes, and parameters.

[Minitidal](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary) supports a wide subset of functions and features provided by Tidalcycles, specifically designed for use with the [estuary web client](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca).

While not feature complete with Tidalcycles, Minitidal's strengths are twofold:

  - web-based (no installation required to get up and running, Tidalcycles installation is non-trivial)
  - Minitidal in estuary is collaborative by design - it's trivially easy to jam with others, without the inherent security risks posed by common collaborative editors used in Tidalcycles (eg [Flok](https://github.com/munshkr/flok), [Troop](https://github.com/Qirky/Troop))

The Worksheets provided here are designed specifically for use with Estuary, but should work equally well for Tidalcycles (proper) with minimal adjustments.
